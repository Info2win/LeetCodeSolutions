## Q13 romantToInt

- Approach 1

    - Solved by checking every character in a if else if block which is in a for loop

    - 59 lines

- Approach 2 

    - Solved by using a map which stores every single possibility and their's values. A for loop and a if else block is used to check if keys with 2 characters exists.

## Q9 isPalindrome

- Approach 1
    - Solved by first converting int to string with to_string(x) then making a mirror of a string with reverse(mirror.begin(),mirror.end()) then comparing original string to its mirror

## Q20 validParentheses      

- Approach 1
    - Solved by pushing into a stack if it is opening bracket, checked if stack is empty then popded if it is the matching closing bracket if empty or not matches return false, at the end return stack.empty()

## Q21 mergeTwoSortedLists

- Approach 1
    - Solved by first checking if any of the lists are empty, then assigning the low one to the end, then looping through the list1 and list2 and creating the new list until one of the given  lists is reaches to end, lastly pointed the new list's last nodes next to the one of the given lists which did not reach to its end at the end of the while loop.

## Q23 removeDuplicatesFromSortedArray

- Approach 1
    - Kept insertion_place in a variable and looped through the array, if current element is not equal to insertion_place's element inserted current element to the place, returned insertion_place+1 as the uniqe elements' count

    - 15 lines
- Approach 2
    - Used std::unique(nums.begin(),nums.end()) to get all the unique elements at the begining of the array and hold the return value(an iterator to where the unique elements end) in a variable named it,used std::resize(std::distance(nums.begin(),it)) to resize the array of the unique part.

## Q66 plusOne

- Approach 1
    - Returned +1 if last element is not 9, else counted how many 9 we have at the end and popped them then if all the elements of the array was 9 pushed 1 as the first element else incremented the last remaining element once, lastly added the requried zeros at the end

    - 32 lines
- Approach 2
    - Traversed the array back, if element is 9 make it 0 and we have a carry else element++ and no carry, after the traverse back if we have carry that means every element in the array was 9 so push front 1

## Q69 Sqrt(x)
- Approach 1
    - Went through every integer and checked if their square is equal or greater then given integer returned current number if they are equal, returned current number - 1 if square is greater then the given inter

## Q70 climbingStairs
- Approach 1
    - Go through integers until n-1 with a for loop and in the loop do =>  temp = v[0]; v[0] += v[1]; v[1] = temp; // this is O(n) but it is easy to implement
